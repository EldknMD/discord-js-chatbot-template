# discord-js-chatbot-template
A template for simple chatbots on Discord.
Using this template, you should be able to mount your own brandnew discord bot. 

**This guide will use simple language and is intended for less experienced users.** All important, but not mandatory, topics will be explained in [the wiki](https://github.com/EldknMD/discord-js-chatbot-template/wiki).

*Personal note: I urge you to read it and understand what you do to improve your own code in the future.*

Follow this short instructive for a quick install.

## Quick start guide

To start, you'll need:

- [ ] A [Discord developer account](https://discord.com/developers/applications): You can use your "normal" discord account to login. If you don't have your own account, you can make [a new account for free](https://discord.com/)
- [ ] A PC with stable internet access. *Note: This proccess is based on Windows. I can't tell if it'll be the same on other operative systems.*
- [ ] Basic english language understanding (If you're reading this, it should be enough).
- [ ] A text editor installed on your device. Windows Notepad is enough. I'll use [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for this guide pics.
- [ ] [Node.js library](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed on your PC. You can see that version you need (32 or 64-bit) searching `system information panel` on your system. Panel picture in spanish bellow.
